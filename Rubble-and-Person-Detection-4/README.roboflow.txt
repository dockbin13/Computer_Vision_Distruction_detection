The dataset includes 9101 images.
Rubble-person are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
